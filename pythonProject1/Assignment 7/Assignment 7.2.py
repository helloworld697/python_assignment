'''
The entropy model made 6 mistakes in both directionsâ€”wrongly labeling positives and missing actual positives. 
The gini model also made 6 false positives but only 4 false negatives, meaning it was a bit better at spotting class 1.

For class 0, both models made the same number of mistakes (6 false positives).

Overall, the gini model did a better job, with 88% accuracy, compared to 85% for entropy.

Gini was a little more accurate when identifying negatives (class 0) and slightly better at recognizing class 1.
